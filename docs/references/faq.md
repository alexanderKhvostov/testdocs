## Introduction

Opstrace supports multiple, secured tenants to logically isolate concerns on otherwise shared infrastructure.
If you are not familiar with what a "tenant" is, see our [tenant key concepts](../../references/concepts.md#tenants) documentation.

Tenants are presented in the Cluster Admin section of our UI:

![tenant overview page](../../assets/tenants-guide-overview-1.png)

Let's walk through an example of adding a new tenant named `newtenant` to a running Opstrace instance named `showdown`.

<!-- TODO link to the integrations guide when it exists
If you’re coming from the [quick start](../../quickstart.md), and haven’t yet sent data to one of your tenants, stay tuned for our forthcoming integrations guide to make that process easy.
